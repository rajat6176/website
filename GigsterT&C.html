<p class="privacy middle">1.DEFINITIONS</p>
 
Capitalized terms are defined as set forth below or elsewhere in the Agreement.
1.1 “Services” means the services described in a Gigzo Request for services by a Gigster to a Gigzo Customer.<br><br>
1.2  “Gigzo Request” means a notice provided, through the Application, to one or more Gigsters, which includes a description of the services to be provided by the Gigsters, the time by which the Gigzo Request must be completed (the “Gigzo Completion Date”) and the fee associated with the Gigzo Request (the “Payment”). An open request is a request for services that has not yet been accepted by a Gigster (“Open Request”). Gigsters can use the Application to review Open Requests and to indicate their availability for Open Requests.  Once a Gigster has accepted a Gigzo Request pursuant to Section 2, the Gigzo Request will become a “Gigzo Engagement”. Each Gigzo Engagement constitutes a new contract between Gigzo and the Gigster, and between the Gigster and Requestor.<br><br>
1.3 “Gigzo Mobile Application” or “Application” means the software application used by Gigzo in connection with the Services.<br><br>
<p class="privacy middle">2.  Gigsters</p>
2.1 Background Checks and Privacy Information. As part of your initial registration with Gigzo, you agree to immediately execute a written consent for a background check. Subject to a satisfactory background check and agreement to the terms herein, you will be eligible to use the Gigzo Mobile Application to view and accept Gigzo Requests. You further agree to complete any ongoing background checks as may be required by Gigzo or a Customer. Failure to complete the initial or ongoing background check processes may result in inability to accept Gigzo Requests and/or removal from the Gigzo Platform.

We may also share your information with our payment vendor, in order to verify your payment account to ensure the safety of your account.<br><br>
2.2 Best Efforts. By registering to become a Gigster and accepting an Open Request, you agree to use your best efforts to perform the Gigzo Engagement such that the Services meet the requirements and specifications of the Customer, for whom the Open Request was created. Once a Gigster has accepted a Gigzo Request, the Open Request will no longer be available for performance by other Gigsters who received the Open Request. By accepting an Open Request, you are entering into a binding legal agreement to provide the Services for the Payment specified in the Open Request. Do not accept an Open Request unless you are sure that: <br><br>(1) you understand what you are being asked to deliver;<br><br>(2) you can perform the Services identified in the Open Request; <br><br>(3) you can deliver the Services in the requested time period; and if required, you can get to and from the Customer’s location.  Failure to timely deliver the Services consistent with the Customer’s requirements and specifications will constitute a breach, resulting in non-payment.  Further, in the event of such a breach, you will be responsible for payment of any additional fees (e.g., rush fees) or costs incurred as a result of your failure to timely complete the Open Request in accordance with the Customer requirements.
