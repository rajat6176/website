Please read this Customer Agreement (“Agreement”) in its entirety if you wish to become a customer.
<p>
 
<p class="privacy middle">PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.</p>
<p class="privacy low">ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF CUSTOMER AGREEMENT</p>

This Agreement sets out the terms of the relationship between Gigzo and you.  By signing this Agreement and/or by using the Application or the Gigzo Mobile Application in connection with the Service, you represent that <br><br>(1) you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this agreement, and <br><br>(2) you have the authority to enter into this agreement personally or on behalf of the company you have named as the Customer.  The terms “you”, “Requestor”, “Client” or “Customer” refer to you or the legal entity which you work for or represent.  This agreement includes Gigzo’s Privacy Policy.<br><br>
You agree and understand that certain features of the Application (defined below) may be subject to additional terms and conditions or registration requirements.  You agree to abide by these additional terms and you further agree that a violation of those terms shall constitute a breach of this Agreement. Gigzo reserves the right to change this Agreement, and any additional terms at any time, effective upon making the modified provisions available on the Application or by notifying you directly.  You are responsible for regularly reviewing this Agreement for updates and modifications to its terms.  Continued use of the Application and/or the Gigzo Mobile Application after any such changes are made to this Agreement shall constitute your consent to such changes.  Other than making the changes available on the Application, Gigzo does not and will not assume any obligation to notify Gigsters of any changes to this Agreement, or the creation or modification of any additional terms.

<br><br>

<p class="privacy middle">1.DEFINITIONS</p>
 
Capitalized terms are defined as set forth below or elsewhere in the Agreement.<br><br>
1.1 “Deliverables” means the deliverables specified in a Gigzo Request for delivery by a Gigster to you.<br><br>
1.2 “Gigzo Request” means a notice provided by Gigzo to one or more Gigsters, which includes a description of the services to be provided by the Gigsters and the associated Deliverables, the date by which the Gigzo Request must be completed and the fee for the Gigster who performs the Gigzo Request (the “Payment”).The Payment will be subject to an additional charge to compensate Gigzo for creating, hosting, administering and providing the Application (the “Service Fee”).<br><br>
1.3 “Gigzo Mobile Application” or the “Application” means the software used by Gigzo in connection with the Service.<br><br>
1.4 “Service Request” means a request for Service or work by you which includes a description of the Deliverables for which you wish to engage Gigsters. Once the Customer and Gigster have agreed upon the terms of a Service Request pursuant to Section 2, the Service Request will become a “Service Engagement”.<br><br>
<p class="privacy middle">2. SERVICE REQUEST
</p>
Customer may from time to time submit a Service Request to Gigzo via the Application. We reserve the right to reject any Service Request that is not appropriate, that violates the terms of service or use or that we believe in good faith to be inconsistent with the business interests of Gigzo or the integrity of the Application.
<p class="privacy middle"> 
3. FEES AND PAYMENT
</p>
3.1 Fees.  Gigzo charges fees and collects payment for each Service Engagement. You agree to provide Gigzo with complete and accurate billing and contact information, including but not limited to, Customer’s legal name, address, e-mail address, and the name and telephone number of an authorized billing contact. You agree to update this information within thirty (30) days of any change to it. If the contact information you have provided is false or fraudulent, Gigzo reserves the right to terminate your access to the Service, and any outstanding Service Engagement, in addition to pursuing any available legal remedies. Generally, you will be billed each day for services provided that day.  Special payment arrangements may be made when appropriate.  The Service Fee for engaging a Gigster as an independent contractor totals 15-20% of the Payment amount and is generally for creating, hosting, administering, maintaining and providing the Application (collectively, the “Invoice Amount”).  A Service Request shall be considered complete once the Deliverables have been accepted by Customer in accordance with Section 4. The charge for Service Engagements that involve Gigzo’s payroll application for hiring Gigsters as employees will be determined based on the type of engagement and geographic location of the Gigster and that is mutually agreed upon by Gigzo and you.<br><br>
3.2 Taxes.  Gigzo’s fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including but not limited to value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any local, state, provincial, federal or foreign jurisdiction (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder. If Gigzo has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by Customer.<br><br>
 
3.3 Direct Hire Fee.  In the event Customer or any Customer director, officer, or employee (collectively, “Customer Personnel”) desires to Hire or otherwise directly engage a Gigster outside of the Gigzo Application in the twelve (12) months following Customer’s or any Customer Personnel’s last contact with Gigster through the Gigzo Mobile Application, Customer will notify Gigzo and subsequently Customer will be billed and Customer agrees to pay six hundred rupees (Rs 600) for such direct Hire or other engagement of the Gigster. In the event Customer does not notify Gigzo of direct Hire within 30 days of engaging the Gigster, Customer will be billed and Customer agrees to pay one thousand two hundred rupees (Rs.1200) for such direct Hire. Such Direct Hire Fee shall be charged regardless of whether: (a) Gigster contacts Customer or applies to Customer independently or otherwise through a public job posting or other job board; (b) different Customer Personnel are involved in the direct Hire of the Gigster and previous engagement of the Gigster through the Gigzo Mobile Application; or (c) Customer notifies Gigzo of such direct Hire or engagement of the Gigster. Any hire or engagement of the Gigster by Customer set forth above shall be defined as a “Hire” and shall trigger the Direct Hire Fee, including a full time hire, part time hire, independent contractor hire, intern hire, or any other such engagement where Gigster receives any compensation from Customer. In addition, “Hire” also shall include any situation where Customer who had contact with Gigster through the Gigzo Application provides any information regarding Gigster to a third party and that third party hires Gigster within the twelve (12) month period, in any capacity, whether a full time hire, part time hire, independent contractor hire, intern hire, or any other such engagement or relationship where Gigster receives any compensation, directly or indirectly, from Customer and/or the third party.<br><br>
3.4 Late Cancellation Fee. In the event that Customer cancels a project or a Service Engagement less than three hours before the performance of the service is to begin, the Customer will be required to pay half of the cost of the Service Engagement.  The cost includes both the payment to the Gigster and the fee paid to Gigzo.
3.5 Late Payment Charges. Any invoice which remains unpaid after the due date shall bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month. If the amount of any late payment charge exceeds the maximum permitted by law, the charge will be reduced to that maximum amount.

4.1 Gigzo IP.  Customer acknowledges that all the intellectual property rights in the Application, the Service, the Gigzo Mobile Application, and any metadata or other information generated or submitted to Gigzo by a Gigster in the course of performing a Gigzo Request are owned by Gigzo or Gigzo’s licensors or suppliers (the “Gigzo IP”). Customer shall not obtain, by this Agreement, any right, title or interest in the trademarks of Gigzo or Gigzo’s licensors, affiliates or suppliers, nor shall this Agreement give Customer the right to use, refer to, or incorporate in marketing or other materials the name, logos, trademarks or copyrights of Gigzo or Gigzo’s licensors, affiliates or suppliers.

5.3 Compelled Disclosure.  The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent such disclosure is compelled by law, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party’s cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.<br><br>

<p class="privacy middle">8. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN GIGZO, GIGSTERS AND THE
CUSTOMERS
</p>
8.1 Gigzo provides a platform through which Customers and Gigsters can buy and sell Services online. Under this Agreement (and Gigzo’s service agreement with Gigsters), Gigzo provides services to both Customers and Gigsters, including the provision of a technology platform, aimed at facilitating the formation of contracts between Customers and Gigsters and informally managing disputes related to those contracts. Through the Application, Customers can post Service Requests and invite Gigsters to accept. If a Customer and Gigster agree on terms, including how a Gigster will be classified, a Contract is formed directly between such Customer and Gigster.<br><br>
8.2 The Parties expressly agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency agreement exists between them as a result of this Agreement or any use of the Application.<br><br>
8.3    Worker classification. Customer assumes all liability for proper classification of Gigsters as independent contractors or employees based on applicable legal guidelines. This Agreement does not create a partnership or agency relationship between Customer and Gigster. Gigster does not have authority to enter into written or oral — whether implied or express — contracts on behalf of Customer. Gigster acknowledges that Gigzo does not, in any way, supervise, direct, or control Gigster’s work or Services performed in any manner. Gigzo does not set Gigster’s work hours and location of work, nor is Gigzo involved in determining the type or manner compensation to be paid for any Service Request. Gigzo will not provide Gigster with training or any equipment, labor or materials needed for a particular Request. Gigzo will not deduct any amount for withholding, unemployment, or other taxes as it would in the case of an employee. Customer and Gigster will be solely responsible for all tax returns and payments required to be filed with or made to any federal, state, or local tax authority, in any nation, with respect to Gigster’s performance of Service Requests. For Contracts classified as independent contractor relationships, Customer may not require an exclusive relationship between Customer and Gigster. A Gigster classified as independent contractor is free at all times to perform Requests, be employed by or otherwise engage with persons or businesses other than Customer, including any competitor of Customer. For Contracts classified as employer-employee relationships, Customer will manage the Gigzo Request through Gigzo’s payrolling program, where the Gigster becomes an hourly employee of Gigzo’s staffing affiliate and Gigster and Customer enter into appropriate additional agreements. Customer and Gigster agree to indemnify, hold harmless and defend Gigzo from any and all claims arising out of or related to their Service Request, including but not limited to claims that Gigster was misclassified as an independent contractor, any liabilities arising from a determination by a court, arbitrator, government agency or other body that Gigster was misclassified (including, but not limited to, taxes, penalties, interest and attorney’s fees), any claim that Gigzo was an employer or joint employer of Gigster, as well as claims under any employment-related laws, such as those relating to employment termination, employment discrimination, harassment or retaliation, as well as any claims for overtime pay, sick leave, holiday or vacation pay, retirement benefits, worker’s compensation benefits, unemployment benefits, or any other employee benefits. Customer warrants it will comply with all applicable wage and hour laws, including  federal, state, and local wage and hour laws.
