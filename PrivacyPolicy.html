<p>This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding the Personal Data and Anonymous Data (each as defined below) that we collect from users of our website (located at gigzoapp.com), our mobile applications or related services. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and considered a part of, the Terms of Service, currently located at gigzoapp.com/terms.
 
Our use of information collected through our service is limited to the purpose of providing the service for which you (“User”) have engaged Gigzo.
The specific information we collect through our service is dependent on how you use our service:<br><br>
 
You may use Gigzo as a “Gigster”, which means we collect information such as that needed to onboard you, run a background check, notify you of suitable jobs, provide you with information and updates relating to jobs and pay you for work performed.
 
You may use Gigzo as a “Requestor”, which means we collect information such as that needed to promote jobs you have to Gigsters, provide you with updates relating to those jobs and charge you for work performed.<br><br>
 
By submitting or making available Personal Data or Anonymous Data through our website, mobile applications or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your Personal Data and Anonymous Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<p>
 
<p class="privacy middle">Data We Collect<p>
 
We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our site, when you use our mobile applications and when you send us information or communications:
“Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, phone number, pin code, location and email address.<br><br>
“Anonymous Data” means data about you that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data.<br><br>
 
We collect Personal Data from you, such as first and last name, phone number, pin code, email, professional title, company name, and password, when you use our website, applications or services, or post information in our support system. In addition, we (or our third-party credit card, payment processors and background check processors on our behalf) may collect Personal Data including your credit card number, bank account information , Adhaar card information and Pan card information when you use Gigzo, for the purpose of providing services that are an integral part of Gigzo, such as running background checks and paying you for work done. We also retain information on your behalf, such as the Personal Data described above and any correspondence. If you provide us feedback or contact us via email, we will collect your name and email address, as well as any other content included in the email, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us. When you post in our public support forums, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it.<br><br>
 
To request removal of your personal information from our public forums, contact us at support@gigzoapp.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as browser version, operating system and version, phone model and version, and other requested information if you contact us for support. We may also collect Personal Data at other points in our website or mobile applications that state that Personal Data is being collected.<br><br>
 
We link the information we store in cookies to the personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a personalized experience. If you choose to disable Cookies, some functions of our Services may not work properly.<br><br>
 
In order to notify you of suitable jobs, we use the location information provided by your phone through the Gigzo application. We may receive updates to your location even when the Gigzo application is running in the background. You are able to use your phone settings to prevent Gigzo from obtaining your location. However, this will mean that you will be unable to receive notifications from Gigzo of suitable jobs.<br><br>
 
<p class="privacy middle">Our Use of Data<p>
 
Personal Data you submit to us is used either to respond to requests that you make, or to provide the Gigzo service.

We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that makes the data personally identifiable to you.

We reserve the right to use Anonymous Data for other purposes and to disclose Anonymous Data to third parties at our discretion.<br><br>

If Gigzo is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.<br>
